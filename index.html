We had to make the tough decision to close our restaurant temporarily as a precautionary measure against the spread of the coronavirus.
The health and well-being of our consumers, team and community is our top priority and we believe social distancing is part of the answer to prevent the spread of the virus.
We have taken additional measures in cleaning as a response to COVID-19 however, in our restaurant business being in close proximity to one another is unavoidable. 
We felt it is best to close our family business for now as a preventive measure to keep our staff and guests healthy. Beginning March 17th, we will be closed until further notice. 

Thank you to our customers and community for your continued support of our small business in such a challenging time. 
We are hopeful that we will all get through this and when it passes over we hope to serve you again. 

In the meantime, we will miss you a lot! Please take care of yourself and your families. 

With lots of love,

Tin Tin Buffet
